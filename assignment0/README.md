First assignment for CS290 class (Web Development)

# 5 Websites I like or dislike
------------------------
[stallman.org](https://www.stallman.org/)
------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - I enjoy the haphazard setup and wild variety of topics
  - The page layout reminds me of the 90s
  - From the creator of the GNU project
  - Very wide range of topics which users might find interesting

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - There is no cohesive, unifying reason to have the site, besides the ramblings of a misunderstood genius
  - Little interaction on the site
  - Lack of options for user (dark mode, suggested pages, etc)
  - The page layout will mostly be seen as a bad thing by most people

------------------------
[pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com/)
------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - I like the simplicity of the UI on the home page  
  - Updated constantly, rarely showing out of date info  
  - Aesthetically appealing  
  - Easy change search filters/parameters  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - Hard to find some PC parts in the dropdowns, like Monitors  
  - Not a complete list of internet PC part deals  

------------------------
[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/) and [old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com/)
------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - The visual layout is great for a forum  
  - easy to use search bar to find desired topic  
  - everything on the site seems to work smoothly  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - A lot of ads and ads that are disguised as posts  
  - reddit and old.reddit are different, that could be bad.  

------------------------
[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/)
------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - Very useful search bar
  - I will never run out of things to watch
  - Everything works
  - Never seen a 502 error

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - designed using social engineering to keep users on the site for as long as possible
  - I will never run out of things to watch
  - systematically removes videos that do not align politically with youtube's desires (I loved watching conspiracy videos about Antarctica on youtube, then one day thay were all gone)
  - Lots of ads and they are trying to say people using adblcokers are bad people

------------------------
[coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com)
------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - Easy for beginners to use
  - Simple layout that guides user through the crypto process, step by step
  - Access to magic internet money
  - This site is also almost never down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - The rules and fees can be difficult to find (support)
  - Does not explain the purpose of magic internet money, nor does it ever mention self-governance (makes sense, they are a business and they want to hold on to it for you)
  - They recently created "coinbase advanced" and that made the site rather clunky, but lowers fees for user
  - Refresh will often not work, and user has to exit the site and come back
  - Layout is somewhat counter-intuitive. I think it might be better on mobile
