# 5 Websites I like or dislike
------------------------
1) richardstallman.org
------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - I enjoy the haphazard setup and wild variety of topics  
  - The page layout reminds me of the 90s  
  - From the creator of the GNU project  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - There is no cohesive, unifying reason to have the site  
  - Little interaction on the site  
  - Lack of options for user  

------------------------
2) pcpartpicker.com
------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - I like the simplicity of the UI on the home page  
  - Updated constantly, rarely showing out of date info  
  - Aesthetically appealing  
  - easy to find and change search filters/parameters  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - Hard to find some PC parts in the dropdowns, i.e. Monitors  
  - Not a complete list of internet PC part deals

3) reddit.com and old.reddit.com
------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - The visual layout is great for a forum  
  - easy to use search bar to find desired topic  
  - everything on the site seems to work smoothly  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - A lot of ads, and ads that are disguised as posts  
  - reddit and old.reddit are different, that could be bad.
