------------------------
richardstallman.org
------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - I enjoy the haphazard setup and wild variety of topics  
  - The page layout reminds me of the 90s  
  - From the creator of the GNU project  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - There is no cohesive, unifying reason to have the site  
  - Little interaction on the site  
  - Lack of options for user (dark mode, suggested pages, etc)  

------------------------
pcpartpicker.com
------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - I like the simplicity of the UI on the home page  
  - Updated constantly, rarely showing out of date info  
  - Aesthetically appealing  
  - Easy change search filters/parameters  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - Hard to find some PC parts in the dropdowns, like Monitors  
  - Not a complete list of internet PC part deals  

------------------------
reddit.com and old.reddit.com
------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - The visual layout is great for a forum  
  - easy to use search bar to find desired topic  
  - everything on the site seems to work smoothly  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - A lot of ads, and ads that are disguised as posts  
  - reddit and old.reddit are different, that could be bad.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good:  
  - Very useful search bar
  - I will never run out of things to watch
  - Everything works

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad:  
  - designed using social engineering to keep users on the site for as long as possible
  - I will never run out of things to watch
  - systematically removes videos that do not align politically with youtube's desires (I loved watching conspiracy videos about Antarctica on youtube, then one day thay were all gone)
  - Lots of ads and they are trying to say people using adblcokers are bad people
